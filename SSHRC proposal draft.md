# SSHRC Proposal

## Objective

1. Evaluate Parks Canada Agency's (PCA) progress towards complying with its treaty obligations, federal law, UNDRIP, and mandate, as regards its relationships with Indigenous Peoples.
2. Identify potential remedies and next steps toward repairing relationships
3. Create a baseline analysis of how Indigenous land use and stewardship is being affected by PCA jurisdiction across a wide range of geopolitical areas.
- Despite ongoing criticisms, the exclusion-based conservation paradigm which emerged out of colonial nature/culture dichotomies has remained dominant (Shults and Heffner, 2016). 
- Although a few studies examine individual aspects of Parks Canada's relationships with Indigenous Peoples, they are usually based on experiences at one park, and/or fail to assess the issue as a legal one, instead focusing on an *ethical* rights-based approach, rather than a *legal* rights-based approach. While the two are not mutually exclusive and examinations of the ethics is extremely important, there is a lack of data about PCA's legal compliance, which this research seeks to address.

## Hypothesis
- A major gap in the existing literature is a comprehensive analysis of PCA's policies and practice, with respect to its major commitments and legal obligations. By analyzing not just the ethics of PCA's behaviour, but its compliance/non-compliance with the law and commitments, a deeper understanding of operational solutions will emerge. PCA has a history of non-compliance (Gowland 2019, UNESCO CITATION HERE), and an institution-wide analysis will reveal current commitment-compliance gaps, and inform policy-makers and Indigenous communities and decision-makers about what actions have been most worthwhile.

## Methods
- Mixed methods approach, as Indigenous knowledge production and holding does not fit cleanly into Western academic or scientific paradigms, such as the dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative analysis.
- TRC recommendations 43 and 44
- Sheryl Lightfoot's spectrum of compliance
- Community-driven approach and outcomes which seek to keep Indigenous knowledge within Indigenous communities, support Indigenous data governance, improve community progress towards community goals, contribute to supporting the intellectual property of Indigenous peoples and the land, and deliver on collective goals. Indigenous knowledge will be centered rather than pushed to the sidelines (Hunt 2017, Kovach 2021), serving as the default world view to the maximum of my ability, as a settler researcher, to do so without the embodied experience and knowledge of Indigeneity (Hunt 2017).
- Authorship and responsible citations
- Research sites selected based on (==CITE ALL THESE==):
    - *Litigation (Lake Superior National Marine Protected Area, Wood Buffalo National Park)*
    - *Past studies (Gwaii Haanas, Jasper, Banff, Revelstoke, Kootenay, Wood Buffalo National Parks)*
    - *Indigenous news releases, publications and testimony (Wood Buffalo National Park, Georgian Bay/Bruce Peninsula, Point Grondine)*
    - *PCA datasets
- Deliverables: land-use map using ArcGIS Pro; interpretive programming; a comprehensive monitoring report on PCA's progress against its goals and obligations

## Significance
- Indigenous land significance maps (also known as 'traditional land use' maps) are often an essential component of Indigenous efforts to have their human, Treaty and UNDRIP rights recognized. Maps created during this research will be essential for producing the monitoring report, but can also signficantly benefit Indigenous partners in any current or future effort to have their rights honoured.
- The ability of art and communication to effect conciliation has been well documented (Simpson 2010, 98; Schlink 2009). Creating interpretative programming can assist Indigenous communities with raising awareness and communicate their experiences through a means which is both culturally appropriate and seen as 'legitimate' by Parks Canada.
- By holding Parks Canada to the standard of its own obligations, rather than abstract ethics, this research can serve as an external audit of PCA's progress, to be used in litigation by Indigenous nations, or internally to improve outcomes and behaviour within the Agency.
