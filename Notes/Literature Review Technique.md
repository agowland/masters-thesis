## Reading

- "Start by reading the abstracts"
- "In your final report, you may briefly indicate areas of research that you have considered and rejected from detailed consideration."
- "The relevant sources may be cited in a short paragraph or table, but do not overdo it, you need most of your word count for the main story."
- By the point where I'm at the ***detailed planning stage*** of my thesis I should have "read many academic articles" -- I don't have to be at that stage right *now*.
- "[T]he key to a good literature review is effective, critical and active reading."
- "Note the really important ideas, you do not need all the details in most cases. Most reviews will cover too much material to remember it all."
- "It is [...] vital to link one source to another, for example noting articles with similar methodologies; results that agree; or outcomes that are contradictory."
    - Try creating a mindmap to track these relationships


 ### Notes

- [ ] Copy the reference or citation (e.g. export to EndNote)
- [ ] Summarize **in two sentences** what [the source] is about
- [ ] Summarize the conclusion in one sentence
- [ ] Identify the strong points of the article, and highlight in your notes
- [ ] Sort the notes into different sections, by theme.
  - [ ] What does this source add?
  - [ ] Does it fill a gap in my research or corroborate another account?
  - [ ] What two sources does the source cite the most? Read their abstracts.
  - [ ] What are the strengths and weaknesses of the argument and evidence?
  - [ ] Does the author miss anything?
  - [ ] What other sources does this best fit with?

## Structure

- The lit review should make sense for the story you're trying to tell; it should be a narrative that helps set the scene for your story. Worry less about how others think it should be written and write it the way this research needs it to be written.
- The literature will change over time; the goal right now is to create a draft that gets added to as the project evolves
- Start with subheadings, this:
  - Keeps things organized so that similar authors and concepts are grouped together
  - Allows for the paper to be easily re-organized after it's written so that things are presented in the most logical way with minimal rewriting
  - What is the best way to present the material? 
    - Diagrams, tables and flow charts are all acceptable
  - Typically, literature reviews start with the background and then lead into the most relevant research in your area, before moving into the gap that your reasearch is going to fill.
  - Possible inclusions:
    - High-level background information, covering concepts and fields; think of this as a way to tell the reader what street they're on, in case they've taken a wrong turn
    - Sections that discuss the main themes that have been explored by other authors, making sure that the themes included here are actually relevant to the current research, or explaining why they're included if their relevancy isn't obvious (e.g. if there isn't a lot of relevant research that's already been done)
    - A section that notes the gaps in scholarship, including questions that other authors have presented for future research, and the areas that no research has explored (show where your research fits in, and how your research contributes to the present and future body of knowledge)
