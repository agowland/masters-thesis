# Context Paper Instructions
- 15-20 pages double-spaced
- Literature review
  - **A Few Different Approaches**
  - *Thematic*
    - Identify your subfield, and discuss the key themes
    	- Start in the broad area of interest and then narrow it down to the three or four main themes that are most relevant
    		-  Narrow it down further to the main theme you want to explore in your project
  - *Chronological/Narrative Approach*
    - Less common in the sciences
      - Start with seminal texts, take the reader through the epistemology of the topic or subfield
  - *Paradigm*
    - Key theories or approaches
    - Similar to thematic, but the 'themes' are actual theories or paradigms
  - *Intersectional*
    - Examining the points of intersection between the fields we're pulling from
    - For my paper specifically, where is the point where jurisprudence, geography, resource management and political science intersect? What do those intersections look like?
## Questions
- How many sources is appropriate at the Masters level? Both for the actual thesis and for this context paper?
  - The example paper that's on Brightspace is a good starting point re: appropriate number of sources
