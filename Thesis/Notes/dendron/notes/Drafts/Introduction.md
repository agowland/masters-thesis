# Prologue/Introduction; "National Treasures"

    The National Parks journal I've found on Etsy wants me to place a checkmark in the box next to the tidy list of Canada's national parks, for whichever one I am presumably at. I am struck by how overtly they've been turned into commodoties, these places that I have visited and know to be alive. A small creator based in Montr√©al is selling iron-on patches that say "National Parks of Canada -- Respect & Enjoy" around an image of a loon superimposed on a moose, superimposed on a lake, which is superimposed on a maple-leaf-cum-mountain-range. The seller also offers patches with other 'fun' slogans, like, "I'm a little loonie," and "Maple Syrup -- I'd tap that"[PoutinePress](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/PoutinePress).
