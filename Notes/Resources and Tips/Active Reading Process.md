# Active Reading Technique(s)

- Remember to use "Read Aloud" and "Immersive Reader" in Microsoft Edge
- Import into Kurtzweil 3000 when available
- Get audiobooks when availabl, and look for plugins for VSCode and Obsidian that allow notetaking on audio, or use Nvivo if that will work

### Survey -- Scan Intro & Conclusion

    - How recent is this?
    - How relevant is this?
      - Not relevant? Stop reading and move to a lower priority folder

### Question -- Relevancy & Main Arguments

    - What does this source add? Does it fill a gap in my research or corroborate another account?
    - Deep read or quick scan for background notes?
      - Background = take notes on abstract, intro, conclusion
        - Source dos not contribute many new concepts or theories
        - Not as relevant as other sources
        - Helps set the context of the research question, but does not meaningfully contribute to answering it
      - Deep read = thorough notes
        - Source is a foundational text in the field or subject being researched
        - Source is highly relevant
        - Source contributs many new idas, concpts or a new perspective
        - Source fills a gap in the literature

### Read -- Selection

    - Skip less relevant sections or chapters
    - Skim-read first to identify which sections to take notes on
      - If it's a background source, it's fine to *only* skim-read

### Recall

    - Explain the article in your own words (e.g. a paragraph which can be contributed to an annotated bibliography, or a notetaking template that has the citation information, authours' main argument, and strengths and weaknesss of their approach and conclusions)

### Review

    - Connect the source to other sources or to a wider context
    - What are the strengths and weaknesses?
    - Did the author(s) miss anything?
