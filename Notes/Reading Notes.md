## Indigenous Ways of Kknowing and Being

- Johnson, D. E., Parsons, M., & Fisher, K. (2022). Indigenous climate change adaptation: New directions for emerging scholarship. *Environment and Planning E-Nature and Space, 5*(3), 1541-1578. <https://doi.org/10.1177/25148486211022450>

    A growing body of literature has started to examine climate adaptation studies from a perspective which centers Indigenous knowledge and experience. Johnson, Parsons and Fisher draw on the literature surrounding climate change adaptation, intersectional studies and decolonization frameworks to analyze how well Indigenous contexts are being analyzed and accepted in climate change response. Significantly, the authors identify that even though scholars and practitioners in these three realms have called for the examination of the ways in which Indigenous experiences of climate change differ in every context, scholarship which aims to decolonize climate change and climate adaptation scholarship has actually made little progress on that front. Reviewing available literature, Johnson, Parsons and Fisher highlight the importance of intersectionality, heterogenous perspectives, and long-term relationships in decolonizing climamte change adaptation scholarship. 

- Dickson-Hoyle, S., Ignace, R.E., Ignace, M. B., Hagerman, S. M., Daniels, L. D. and Copes-Gerbitz, K. (2022). Walking on two legs: a pathway of Indigenous restoration and reconciliation in fire-adapted landscapes. *Restoration Ecology 30*(4). <https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.13566>

    The authors contend that despite increasing recognition of the need for Indigenous-led and Indigenous-partnered conservation research and programs to ensure success, not enough attention has been paid to actual techniques for intgrating Indigenous perspectives and agency. 

## Parks Canada History and Culture

- Langdon, S., Prosper, R., & Gagnon, N. (2010). Two Paths One Direction: Parks Canada and Aboriginal Peoples Working Together. *The George Wright Forum, 27*(2), 222-233. http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/stable/43598154 

    This older article posits that the most important legal frameworks for Indigenous Peoples in Canada are the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the 1982 Constitution Act and "various statutes and court decisions" (222). The authors claim, even in 2010, that Parks Canada "considers Aboriginal peoples as partners," before stating that its historic track record is not as noble (222). Langdon, Prosper and Gagnon credit Agency-level "culture shifts" in response to changes in government policy and priorities, with respect to Indigenous relations, with its current approach to Indigenous relations. Blatant, unquestioning generalizations about PCA and its relationships are frequent, and the article is written with a strong emphasis on PCA's successes, mostly based on quantitative data from PCA itself. This article is good for demonstrating the current status quo and popular attitudes towards Parks Canada and its path toward 'reconciliation'.
