Johnson, D. E., Parsons, M., & Fisher, K. (2022). Indigenous climate change adaptation: New directions for emerging scholarship. *Environment and Planning E-Nature and Space, 5*(3), 1541-1578. https://doi.org/10.1177/25148486211022450

    - A growing body of literature has started to examine climate adaptation studies from a perspective which centers Indigenous knowledge and experience. Johnson, Parsons and Fisher draw on the literature surrounding climate change adaptation, intersectional studies and decolonization frameworks to analyze how well Indigenous contexts are being analyzed and accepted in climate change response. Significantly, the authors identify that even though scholars and practitioners in these three realms have called for the examination of the ways in which Indigenous experiences of climate change differ in every context, scholarship which aims to decolonize climate change and climate adaptation scholarship has actually made little progress on that front.
