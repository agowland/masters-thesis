  - Quotes from Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson,Leonardo da Vinci, Charles William Beebe, Edwin Way Teale, and John Muir
  - "The new century ushered in new thinking about health. People were starting to believe that outdoor living, particularly the scent of pine trees, was beneficial for many ailments, and they started spending time away from cities in more natural surroundings. [...] People who could afford to escape city life in the hot summer did so..." Mary I. Garland, qtd. p. 196

### Jonas, H., Makagon, J. and Roe, D. (2016). Conservation Standards: From Rights to Responsibilities. *IIED Discussion Paper.*

  - "Although there have been strong critiques of shared governance arrangements and decision-making, the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve an the Haida Heritage Site, and the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve [...] are often considered to be uniquely effective examples of collaboration."

### Whitehead, J. (2022). *Making Love With the Land*

  - "My belly is a prairie, my belly is the bush, <mark>my belly is a wild land, hinterland, ancestral land."</mark> (12)
    - Embodiment of the land in Indigenous experience
  - "Even as we become nothing, meaning that which cannot be named, meaning an embodiment beyond an English understand, we become all-things, we become kin on a microscopic, hypermetropic, mutiplicitous level." (15)

### Tadaki, M., Brierley, G., and Callum, C. (2014). River classification: theory, practice, politics. *WIREs Water* ___ (_). 349-367. doi:10.1002/wat2.1026

  - "Recent work in environmental studies has drawn attention to the role of value judgements exercised through the conduct of environmental science, and how these contribute to enacting institutions of governance. <mark>Emerging understandings of the partial, contested, and fragile nature of 'evidence' opens up to political contest decisions about *whose* evidence matters, and *how* evidence should be interpreted and acted upon in decision-making frameworks."</mark> (349-50)

### Atleo, E. R. (2004). *Tsawalk: A Nuu-chah-nulth Worldview.* UBC Press.
> In the Nuu-chah-nulth language, *heshook-ish tsawalk* means "everything is one." *Heshook-ish tsawalk* is a Nuu-chah-nulth perspctive that is inclusive of all reality, both physical and metaphysical. (xi)

> Clement C.J. Webb in *A Hisory of Philosophy* maintains that modern civilization begins with "leaving off telling tales". That is, according to this philosopher, modern civilization could not begin until people turned away from their ancient origin "tales" and began to think in scientific terms. In conrast to this view, the theory of Tsawalk not only begins with these "tales," or origin stories, but also depends on these "tales" both as the foundation of knowledge about the state of existence and as a guide for its interpretation. (xi)

> [Reason] has reached a degree of imbalance so extreme that the mythological importance of reason obscures all else and has driven the other elements into the marginal frontiers of doubtful respectability (John Ralston Saul 1993, qtd. in Atleo pp. xii).

> Reason, or rationality, is a cornerstone of science. (xii)

> What is the source of this imbalance between reason and spirit? The imbalance can be traced to scientific methodology. (xii)

>The assumption that knowledge is acquired only through human reason may be predicated upon the worldview that primary experience is physical or empirical and that other experiences are secondary. An extreme interpretation of this view is that all spiritual reality is simply an imaginary creation of the human mind. <mark>All extraordinary human experiences that cannot be explained by empirical means are mere delusions or figments of human imagination.</mark> (xv)

>Peace, order, and good government as ideals of Western civilization have not been practically realized. (xix)

> People who consider themselves the most advanced and most progressive have brought the earth to its most advanced state of peril. (xix) 
  - *Colonial (mis)management*

> What are these Western assumptions [of civilization]? One is that the nature of the universe can be illuminated only by the human mind. This assumption is related to another: that <mark>**those humans who told tales were unscientific and therefore could have no substantive and reliable knowledge about the nature of existence.**</mark> Legends, myths, and origin stories belong to a "primitive" phase of human evolution. (xix)
>   - *Indigenous knowledge*

>When, in their duality, *quus* (humans) become more focused on their physical selves than on their spiritual selves, the imbalance creates a shortage of good spiritual power. The spiritual self weakens from disuse, from a lack of exercise. Physical power can be very potent, but it is insufficient for coping with all of life's challenges and problems. (46)
  - Imbalance also comes from "a laxness in teachings and observances" and is "made manifest in [acts of tragedy rendered by evil spirits]." (46)
  - *Indigenous knowledge*

>The principle of free will and respect between the earth and the spirit realm must be maintained. [...] <mark>It might be said that there is mutual recognition, mutual respect, and mutual responsibility between the spiritual and earthly communities. Qua-ootz, the Creator, Owner of Reality, does not exercise power arbitrarily over the lives of *quus* upon earth. There are protocols to be observed.</mark>" (46)
