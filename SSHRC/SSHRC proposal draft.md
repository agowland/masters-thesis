# This Time Without Earplugs: Evaluating Parks Canada's Compliance with Legal and Policy Commitments

## Objective
Despite ongoing criticisms, the exclusion-based conservation paradigm which emerged out of colonial nature/culture dichotomies has remained dominant, despite efforts toward 'co-management' (Mitchell 2021, Hunt 2017, Simpson 2011, Kovach 2021, Wilson 2008, Shultis and Heffner 2016, Nadasdy 2003, Jos & Watson 2019). The purpose of this research is to a) evaluate Parks Canada Agency's (PCA) progress towards complying with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action (including treaty obligations, UNDRIP, PCA mandate; TRC 2015, 4-5), as regards its relationships with Indigenous Peoples, b) identify potential remedies and next steps towards repairing relationships, c) create a baseline analysis of how Indigenous land use and stewardship is being affected by PCA jurisdiction across a wide range of geopolitical areas. 

## Hypothesis
Although a few studies examine individual aspects of Parks Canada's relationships with Indigenous Peoples, they fail to assess the issue as a systemic legal one, instead focusing on a local, *ethical* rights-based approach, rather than a widespread *legal* rights-based approach. A major gap in the existing literature, therefore, is a comprehensive analysis of PCA's policies and practice, with respect to its major commitments and legal obligations. 

## Methods
Indigenous knowledge will be centered rather than pushed to the sidelines (Hunt 2017, Kovach 2021). All details of the research will be disclosed with potential community partners, so that they are in a position to provide, or withhold, *enthusiastic* consent, keeping in mind that many communities are experiencing research fatigue and are overburdened by time requests (Kovach 2021, 125).

Using Sheryl Lightfoot's spectrum of compliance (Lightfoot 2016), as well as numbers 43, 44, 45, 47, 53 and 57 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action (TRC 2015, 4-5), I will evaluate PCA's location on a compliance matrix. Data collection procedures will be developed using a community-driven approach which seeks to keep Indigenous knowledge within Indigenous communities, supports data governance, improves community progress toward community goals, and contributes to protecting the intellectual property of Indigenous peoples and the land. Research sites will be selected based on (Pearkes 2022; Johnston 2020; Finegan 2018; Youdelis 2016, Thomlinson & Crouch 2012, Hamel v. PCA 2022; UNESCO 2017; Weber 2019; Pearkes 2022): a) litigation; c) Indigenous news releases, publications and testimony; and d) PCA datasets. 

## Significance
PCA has a history of under-compliance (Gowland 2020, UNESCO 2017, Lightfoot 2016), and an institution-wide analysis will reveal current commitment-compliance gaps, and inform policy-makers, Indigenous communities and decision-makers about what actions have been most worthwhile. By holding Parks Canada to the standard of its own obligations, rather than abstract ethics, this research can serve as an external audit of PCA's progress, to be used in litigation by Indigenous nations, or internally, to improve outcomes and behaviour within the Agency.
