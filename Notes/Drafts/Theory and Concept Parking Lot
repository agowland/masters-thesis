# Theory and Concept Parking Lot

- Public land ownership as collectivized private ownership --> "this land is mine/yours/ours, but not theirs"
  - Exclusion of Indigenous history & deligitimization of Indigenous sovereignty
  - Exclusion of Indigenous relationship to the land as something which is kin, rather than property
- Conceptualization of Indigenous landscapes as "wilderness" also removes Indigenous people (who live there) from the idea of 'civilization' and 'society'
  - If the 'wilderness' is where you go to get away from 'society', then the 'wilderness' is without society
    - Wilderness is rendered 'pre-modern' and anti-social; a new way of calling Indigenous peoples 'uncivilzed' instead of acknowledging non-human societies and 'civilizations'
- If we can expect, and force, Indigenous Peoples to center colonial epistomologies and assimilate, we, as settlers, can also assimilate and center Indigenous knowledge
